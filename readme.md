This started out as a "multiplayer" rock paper scissors game. And when I say multiplayer, I mean setting up N rooms based on (N/2) players--which eventually scaled back to 5 different rooms, and preventing/showing players connected to each room; unique usernames, and a global and room chat. And I bit off WAY more than I could chew. The trash folder located here has the start of the rps game if you want to look at 4days of head smashing. I will be coming back to this, it will not defeat me.
